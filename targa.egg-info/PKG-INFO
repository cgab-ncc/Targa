Description: # Targa (Targetable Genes Analysis)
        
        Targa is a python package for identifying targetable genes using gene expression data.<br>
        The project was started in 2017 at National Cancer Center of Korea.
        
        ## Installation
        ### Dependencies
        Targa requires:
        * Python (>= 2.7)
        * numpy
        * scipy
        * pandas
        
        ### Installation
        To install Targa, run the install command:
        ```
        pip install -U targa
        ```
        
        ## Getting Started
        Here are example python codes for using Targa<br>
        Load data
        ```
        import targa as tg
        import pandas as pd
        
        gene_expression_file = "data/sample_gene_expression_file.csv"
        clinical_data_file = "data/sample_clinical_data_file.csv"
        
        ```
        
        ## Getting Started
        Load data
        ```
        from targa.data import make_dataset
        
        genomic_matrix_file = "/data/raw/genomicMatrix"
        clinical_data_file = "/data/raw/clinical_data"
        genomic_clinical_data = make_dataset.GenomicClinicalData(genomic_matrix_file=genomic_matrix_file,
        clinical_data_file=clinical_data_file)
        ```
        
        Generate features from genomic and clinical data
        ```
        
        ```
        
        Rank the genes using the TOPSIS method
        ```
        
        ```
        
        Or, rank the genes using the rank product method
        ```
        
        ```
        
        Perform enrichment analysis of the ranked genes
        ```
        
        ```
